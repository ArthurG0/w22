Hello dear students! My name is Arthur, I really enjoy teaching, and I'm proud to be representing our wonderful department in the role of a Teaching Assistant. I've previously been a ULA for the CS Department at UCSB for 8 quarters, and this is my first time TA'ing (one can only TA as a graduate student). I've been born and raised in Russia, but now my family and I live in California. At UCSB, I'm enrolled in the 5-year Master's program called BS/MS because I wanted to learn the material beyond the scope of our 4-year program. At first as an undergraduate, I've used to look down on Python because of its quirks and always preferred C++ to Python due of its structure and speed, but over time I learned to like Python, and now it is my go-to in technical interviews and coding up something fast. This quarter, I will look for opportunities to compare Python to other languages so you don't just learn Python in a vacuum, for those interested. I want to welcome all of you to CSW 8 - this will be an exciting journey, and we will all learn a lot in these next 10 weeks. Our job is to make this journey interesting and fun, to give you plenty of opportunities to get help and ask questions, and spread our love of coding to you. Please do not hesitate to contact us for anything course- or major- or else-related, and I look forward to meeting many of you very soon!
