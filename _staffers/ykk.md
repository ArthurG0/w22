Hi everyone! I am really excited about teaching this class again, since every time we offer it, we learn something new about how to present the introductory Computer Science concepts in a more intuitive, fun or creative way. 

When I am not sharing my passion for Computer Science and Data Science, you used to be able to find me chatting with students, organizing board-game nights, drinking copious amounts of tea, and/or enjoying the beautiful Santa Barbara weather.
This term, however, I'm going to be on the other side of the world (12 time zones ahead of Santa Barbara), and while I will still be drinking lots and lots of tea and trying to organize (virtual) game nights, my focus is much more reflective, focusing on my and students' learning experiences, drawing the parallels between the lessons in the classroom and those we encounter outside of it.
