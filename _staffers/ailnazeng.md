Hi CSW8, 

I’m Lina (she/her/hers): a fourth-year Computer Science (CS) major and Education minor who has taken this class back in F18, so I’ve been in your same spot. I’ve also been a ULA for this class back in S20 so… I’ve also been in my own same spot. 

I’m excited to be back because my mission in college has always been to create safe spaces to learn more, make mistakes, and be yourself. I hope I can do that here in CSW8 where many of you are touching programming for the first time. I hope that by the end of the 10 weeks, we will all have learned at least something about programming and each other. 

I am now retired from many CS-related activities but if you have any questions about the following, let me know: I was previously president of Oceana Hacks, formerly known as Women/Hacks, a 36-hour beginner-friendly hackathon catered toward gender minorities in technology. I was also part of the Early Research Scholars Program (ERSP) 2019-2020 cohort for the Machine Learning in Computer Vision group lead by Professor Hollerer. I’m also a member of Society of Women Engineers, Women in Computer Science, and Theta Tau. 

If I’m not doing something school-related, I’m probably napping, snacking, dancing (poorly), playing Teamfight Tactics (also poorly), or making a spreadsheet (beautifully).
