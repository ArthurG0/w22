Hi Everyone! I'm a first year master's student in CS at UCSB. A bit about me - I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering in 2019. After that, I worked as an Android Engineer at PhonePe - a Fintech company in India. While my preferred language to code in is Java, I absolutely love convenient and simple Python is for people just starting to learn how to code. I've built some cool things using Python, the coolest being a recommendation system using my Spotify music history! I'm really excited to meet you all virtually, and to guide you through this exciting journey of programming!
